# ♻️ AI-Based Waste Collection Decision Support System

An intelligent waste management system that prioritizes garbage collection requests using **fill-level estimation, contamination detection, and decomposition-aware scoring**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to improve urban waste collection efficiency by analyzing waste conditions and generating a **priority score** for each request. The system ensures that high-risk waste (overflowing, contaminated, decomposing) is collected first.

## 🎯 Key Features

* 📦 **Fill-Level Detection** – Estimates how full a bin is
* ⚠️ **Contamination Detection** – Identifies hazardous or mixed waste
* 🧪 **Decomposition Risk Analysis** – Evaluates how long waste has been sitting
* 📊 **Priority Scoring System** – Combines all factors into a final score
* 📍 **Smart Worker Assignment (Optional)** – Assigns nearest worker based on location
* 📈 **Dashboard (Streamlit)** – Displays prioritized collection requests

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

1. Input waste request (image + location + time)
2. Analyze:

   * Fill level (OpenCV)
   * Waste type (CNN model)
   * Decomposition risk (rule-based)
3. Compute priority score
4. Store results in CSV
5. Display in dashboard

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **OpenCV** – Fill level estimation
* **TensorFlow / Keras** – Waste classification model
* **Pandas** – Data handling
* **Streamlit** – Dashboard UI
